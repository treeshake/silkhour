# Coding Challenge

To demonstrate your understand the instructions in the project's `README.md`, please complete a simple code challenge. The code challenge is timed and must be completed in about 30-60 minutes. It does not require setting up the [MTE](modern-tooling-environment), although if you can demonstrate this in your coding challenge, then this is a huge advantage.<br>

### Task

Your task is to extend the product form, and add new a new form field called `Engraving`. This field should be a dropdown. It should be the last field in the product form with options "Yes" and "No". Create a new collection and product to showcase this new field.

### Requirements

You must:

1. Use GitHub and submit your code as a pull request, following the instructions in this README.
2. Clone the existing theme, following the instructions in this README. 
2. Create a new custom product template, you may base it on the default product template
3. Create custom data for the new field and use it in your product.

### Bonus

4. Using the MTE, validate that the Engraving option is set before adding to cart. If it is not selected, show an error message.
